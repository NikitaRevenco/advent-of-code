# Nikita's solutions to the Advent of Code

This is the challenge I put on myself to test my abilities. The goal is to learn 10 **new** languages by using 1 language to solve 25 challenges from each Advent of Code year. I'm already pretty comfortable with TypeScript and Rust, so we won't do those. :-)

Rules:

- No libraries. Only stdlib.
- New year, new language. No repetition.
